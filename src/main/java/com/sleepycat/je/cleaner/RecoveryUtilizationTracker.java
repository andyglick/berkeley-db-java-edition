/**

 * is not always available during recovery.  In fact this is the only reason
 * that a "local" tracker is used during recovery -- to avoid requiring that
 * the DatabaseImpl is available, which is necessary to use the "global"
 * UtilizationTracker.  There is no requirement to accumulate totals locally,
 * since recovery is single threaded.</p>
 *
 * <p>When finished with this object, its information should be added to the
 * Environment's UtilizationTracker and DatabaseImpl objects by calling
 * transferToUtilizationTracker.  This is done at the end of recovery, just
 * prior to the checkpoint.  It does not have to be done under the log write
 * latch, since recovery is single threaded.</p>
